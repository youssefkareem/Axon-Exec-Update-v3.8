## What Is Axon Executor?

**Axon** is a next-generation **Roblox script executor for Windows** built for players who want reliable Lua injection without the bloat, ads, or keys other executors force on you. Unlike browser-based Roblox executors, Axon runs natively on **Windows 10 and Windows 11**, which means lower injection latency, wider script compatibility, and a session-persistent queue that survives Roblox restarts.

Whether you want to **auto-farm Blox Fruits**, **auto-hatch Adopt Me pets**, **grind Pet Simulator X rebirths**, or run your own custom Luau automation, Axon handles it cleanly — no crashes, no detection lag, no paywalls.

**Popular search terms this project covers:** roblox executor 2026, free roblox script executor, no-key executor Windows, best Lua executor for Roblox, blox fruits script executor, adopt me script executor.
